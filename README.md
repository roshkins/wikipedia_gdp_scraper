# Project
Try some web scraping. Find a web page that interests you, preferably one with some cool data presented in a tabular format. (Be sure to check that it’s okay to scrape that site. “Open” projects like Wikipedia are safe places to start.) Find a tutorial for a popular web scraping tool and mimic the code you see there, adapting it to the website you’ve chosen. Along the way, you’ll likely have to learn a little about HTML and CSS. Store the scraped data in a data format like a data frame that is idiomatic in your language of choice. 

# Goal

My goal is to extract the table from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita
